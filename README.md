# Welcome to Disctimeo

I am Muhammad Jabir, an avid Frisbee enthusiast in Singapore and recently just finished a Web Application development module that utilised VueJS and Firebase. I wanted to pick up ReactJS and further explore web development. I figured out what better way to do that other than by merging one of my greatest passions and a budding passion for app development.

Disctimeo is a project I thought of while preparing for my finals and was extremely excited to start developing it. There are some features that I still have in mind such as a tournament listing and a community chat page.

If you have any issues or suggestions regarding existing or new features, do not hesitate to bring them up in the Issues segment

## Motivation

The Ultimate Frisbee Community in Singapore is a small and tightly knit community. Frequent ad-hoc activities occur in Singapore, ranging from weekly pick-ups, scrimmages and small-scale tournaments. Additionally, there are multiple clubs in Singapore that regularly participate in tournaments and hold recruitment trials. These activities are organised by various sources ranging from individuals and clubs and on different platforms.

As a result, there is no centralised repository of information where individuals interested in these activities are able to learn more and sign up for these activities.

## Aim

My aim for DiscTimeo is to create a community hub and website that allows Ultimate Players in Singapore to connect and interact with each other. Users will be able to publish new listings regarding events and their club teams, sign up for pickups and reach a wider audience regarding their club activities.
